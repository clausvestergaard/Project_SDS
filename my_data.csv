5281959998,"The New York Times","Volkswagen called the offer a “good-will package” it hoped would help restore trust with its customers.",NA,"link","http://nyti.ms/1RINGgP","5281959998_10150691850019999",52,21,27,"Volkswagen said on Monday that it would begin talks with worker representatives about how to cut costs, in the latest sign that the company’s crisis over cheating on emissions tests is taking a heavy toll. Separately, the German automaker said it would offer up to $1,000 to owners of diesel cars in the United States affected by the scandal. Some critics quickly called the gesture inadequate. Monday’s carefully worded statement on cost-cutting does not mention layoffs, but nevertheless raises the specter of job reductions at a company with some 614,000 employees, nearly twice as many as Toyota, which produces roughly the same number of vehicles. “In the present difficult situation we must jointly make decisions that factor in economics just as much as employment,” Matthias Müller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in the joint statement with the company’s labor leadership. The combined statement with Bernd Osterloh, the powerful head of the Volkswagen works council, was intended as a show of solidarity between the two sides. There have been signs of tension between Mr. Müller and labor leaders, which is unusual at Volkswagen. Graphic | How Volkswagen Got Away With Diesel Deception Volkswagen has admitted that millions of its diesel cars worldwide were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. The company is now grappling with the fallout. In a letter to employees on Friday, Mr. Osterloh complained that top executives had no clear strategy for addressing the emissions crisis. He also accused Volkswagen managers of making proposals to cut costs without consulting worker representatives. That is taboo at Volkswagen, where according to a special law, workers have veto power over decisions to move or close factories. Partly for reasons like these, open disputes between labor and management are practically unheard-of. On the contrary, the two groups have been accused of being too close, as in 2007 when high-ranking company executives were accused of paying bribes to worker representatives and financing trips abroad that included the services of prostitutes. A former member of Volkswagen’s management board was convicted of bribing top labor representatives, though charges that he had used company funds to pay for prostitutes were dropped. He received a suspended sentence.  While manufacturers in the United States have typically tried to keep unions out of factories, Volkswagen encouraged the United Automobile Workers to organize its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., over the objections of local political leaders. “The work force will stand behind the company,” Mr. Osterloh said in his Monday joint statement with Mr. Müller. But he also said that the support of workers was conditional on “agreeing on a balanced package of investments, economy measures and forward-looking projects.” Interactive Feature | Related VW Coverage  The company said in September that 11 million cars, including about 500,000 in the United States, were rigged to produce artificially low emissions readings when being tested. Then, last week, Volkswagen said that it underreported carbon-dioxide emissions for 800,000 cars in Europe and exaggerated their fuel economy. Volkswagen must now repair the vehicles to make them compliant with emissions limits and repay tax breaks that its customers received from European countries. Volkswagen has already allocated nearly 9 billion euros to cover costs stemming from deceiving regulators and customers. That figure does not include future fines that Volkswagen may be required to pay to national authorities or legal judgments from the hundreds of lawsuits filed by disgruntled customers. Nor does it include other financial fallout, like lost sales. Because of the financial toll, Fitch Ratings said on Monday that it lowered its view of Volkswagen’s creditworthiness. If other ratings agencies follow suit, the company will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money. The offer of up to $1,000 in compensation will be applicable to owners and lessees of 2-liter TDI models affected by the problem in the United States, the company said. The customers would be eligible for a $500 cash card to spend as they wish and another $500 to spend at Volkswagen dealerships, and free 24-hour roadside assistance for three years. Car owners who accept the offer will not be asked to waive future rights to sue or claim other compensation, a Volkswagen spokeswoman said. Volkswagen has already promised to make changes to cars so they comply with emissions limits. The repairs are likely to be costly and complicated, and Volkswagen has not said how they will be carried out. Cars with illegal software include the diesel Volkswagen Golf, Jetta, Beetle and Passat and the diesel Audi A3 sold since the 2009 model year. Volkswagen has already offered cash incentives to owners if they buy or lease a new car, as well as big discounts for new buyers at dealerships. It is unclear whether the offer will be enough to assuage Volkswagen drivers who have expressed anger at the company’s actions. “So basically VW is offering a $500 gift for the fraud it perpetrated on me,” said Elizabeth Humstone, the owner of a 2011 Volkswagen Jetta who lives in Charlotte, Vt., and the chairwoman of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, an environmental group. She said she considered the offer insufficient, saying she was still stuck with a car “I no longer want to drive.” Volkswagen, which called the offer a “good-will package,” also came under criticism from two lawmakers. In a joint statement, Senators Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, called the offer “insultingly inadequate” and a “fig leaf attempting to hide the true depths of Volkswagen’s deception.”  The lawmakers said Volkswagen should offer car owners a buyback option if they wanted to get rid of their cars, or a compensation for the loss of resale value, fuel economy and other damages. Jack R. Nerad of Kelley Blue Book, an auto research organization, said there was a precedent for payments like these. A few years ago, he pointed out, Hyundai agreed to pay a lump sum of $353 to car owners after it admitted to inflating the mileage on some of its models. The Volkswagen offer does not extend to 3-liter Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche models that the Environmental Protection Agency had recently said were also equipped with illegal software. Volkswagen has denied that the software in those cars was designed to cheat on emissions tests. Volkswagen is at the center of multiple investigations in the United States and Europe over the emissions-testing fraud. In the United States, the company faces lawsuits from owners seeking compensation for the decreased resale value of vehicles that were equipped with the illegal software. As Volkswagen contends with the crisis, any job reductions will be particularly tricky to achieve because of the strong voice that worker representatives have in management decisions. Worker representatives hold half of the 20 seats on the supervisory board, in line with laws that apply to all large companies. In addition, the German state of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, has another two seats on the board and generally votes with labor. That means no major decision can be made without worker support. As a result, Volkswagen is likely to do everything possible to avoid forced layoffs of permanent workers. The company could, for example, reduce use of temporary workers, who under German laws have fewer protections against being fired. In addition, Volkswagen could shorten the number of hours worked. In the early 1990s, when a slump in auto sales pushed the company close to bankruptcy, Volkswagen introduced a four-day workweek rather than lay off workers.

The company, which also has parks in Orlando, Fla., and San Antonio, said in a company document posted on Monday that it would replace its theatrical Shamu show in San Diego with an “informative” experience that has a “conservation message inspiring people to act.” The announcement does not affect shows with orcas at the parks in Texas and Florida, said Fred Jacobs, a company spokesman. SeaWorld has been under heavy scrutiny since “Blackfish,” a documentary that criticized the park’s treatment of orcas, was released in 2013, and attendance has suffered. The pressure to stop using the orcas as performers has been particularly intense in California. On Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said he would introduce a bill in Congress that would prohibit the breeding, wild capture and import or export of the whales. In October, the California Coastal Commission banned the breeding of killer whales in captivity, a decision SeaWorld said was an overreach of the agency’s authority. The commission attached the ban to its approval of a proposed expansion of SeaWorld’s whale habitat in San Diego. In a presentation to investors, Joel Manby, SeaWorld’s president and chief executive, said the decision to end the performances was not based on public criticism, as “activists aren’t going to be pleased with anything we do.” But he said guests in San Diego had expressed changing tastes, adding that they wanted a more natural experience simulating how whales would behave in the wild and that they didn’t like actions that appeared to be tricks. “We didn’t do anything in San Diego because of the activists,” Mr. Manby said. “We did it because we’re hearing it from our guests.” In a statement, Jared Goodman, the director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the “end to SeaWorld’s tawdry circus-style shows is inevitable and necessary,” but he called on the company to build sea sanctuaries and stop breeding orcas. “This move is like no longer whipping lions in a circus act but keeping them locked inside cages for life,” he said. Mr. Schiff, in a statement, called the decision a “welcome step” but echoed the call for sanctuaries and the end of breeding. “The fact still remains that as long as SeaWorld holds orcas in captivity, the physical and psychological problems associated with their captivity will persist,” he said. 5:38 AM ETThe country has been accused of acting like a low-tax haven, giving breaks that have attracted international companies.

Don’t buy anything major.’” He kept quiet, but another part of Mr. Asaro, a Mafia yeoman working his way up through New York’s Bonanno crime family, could not resist. He bought a Bill Blass-model Lincoln and a Formula speedboat — symbols of a man who wanted to belong. Mr. Asaro did not realize his world was vanishing. An undated image of Vincent Asaro. U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York Born in 1935, he entered the same business as his father and grandfather, also Mafia members: a company man even if the company business was murder and extortion. Growing old, Mr. Asaro stayed in his old neighborhood in Queens, shopping at Waldbaum’s, sticking with the routines he knew. By then, though, other organized crime groups were squeezing out the New York Mafia with new, sophisticated businesses. More devastatingly for him, Mr. Asaro’s friends, superiors and even a relative began informing on him to the government — providing the material that allowed prosecutors to bring charges after all these years, and shredding the Mafia code that defined his life. Now 80, Mr. Asaro has spent the last three weeks in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the sole defendant in what may be one of the last big Mafia trials, accused of crimes including a 1969 murder, the Lufthansa heist at Kennedy International Airport — a plot point in the Martin Scorsese movie “Goodfellas” — other robberies and extortions. His arm tattoo has been covered up by sweaters. It reads, “Death Before Dishonor.” In closing arguments, Elizabeth Macedonio, a defense lawyer, portrayed the cooperating Mafia witnesses as liars, and Mr. Asaro as someone who, despite years of being surveilled by federal agents, was never once caught doing anything wrong. The case, which went to the jury Monday evening, has depicted a Mafia life from a time when the organization still ruled New York, drawn from testimony, recorded conversations, wiretapped phone calls, court filings and F.B.I. surveillance records going back 40 years. Vincent Asaro was brought down in his old age by a violation of the codes he so embraced; his is the story of the disappearing New York Mafia, and of a disappearing way of life. To get by around Ozone Park, Queens, in the 1950s and ’60s, teenagers had to figure certain things out pretty young. “Down the hole” was an Italian area on the border with Brooklyn. Savvy lottery players picked lucky combinations from the Daily News horse-race charts. And, several people testified, around the time they became teenagers, they realized where the power in the neighborhood lay. Peter Zuccaro, a Mafia associate who testified at Mr. Asaro’s trial, got into a fight over a customer’s not paying for goods at the auto-parts shop where Mr. Zuccaro worked. He was in danger until a Bonanno member intervened, a display of the raw power he came to crave. “It was the thing to do,” he said. “I wanted to be a made member of organized crime.” The five New York families each have a boss, an underboss and a consigliere ruling them. Captains follow, then soldiers. Under that are associates, who are not made, or inducted, members. Salvatore Vitale, a former Bonanno underboss, testified at Mr. Asaro's trial. U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York Salvatore Vitale, a former Bonanno underboss, explained the rules: You did not cooperate with law enforcement. You did not sleep with another member’s wife or daughter. You could sell only pot, not other drugs. Are the rules broken? an assistant United States attorney, Nicole M. Argentieri, asked him. “All the time,” Mr. Vitale replied. This was the family business Mr. Asaro seemed destined for. Anthony Ruggiano Jr., whose father, known as Fat Andy, was a Gambino soldier, began noticing Mr. Asaro when he saw him at Aqueduct or around the neighborhood. Fat Andy said that Mr. Asaro was going to be a third-generation wiseguy, and “thought it was a great thing,” Mr. Ruggiano testified. Map | Vincent Asaro’s Queens  By the 1960s, Mr. Asaro was known as an “earner” in the Bonannos, a prosecutor, Lindsay Gerdes, said. His cousin Gaspare Valenti, a Bonanno associate before he started cooperating with the government, testified about the early crimes they committed together, like hijacking truckloads of Oleg Cassini shirts. The “scores” were often at the direction of James Burke, a powerful Mafia associate who was Irish. (In “Goodfellas,” Robert De Niro plays the character based on Mr. Burke.) In 1969, prosecutors said, Mr. Asaro graduated to murder. One Sunday in 1969, Mr. Asaro and Mr. Burke met Mr. Valenti at a house Mr. Valenti’s father was building in Queens, bringing a sledgehammer and a shovel. “Vinny came up the steps,” Mr. Valenti testified, “and said, ‘We have to bury somebody.’” Mr. Valenti thought he was joking; he was not. The body was that of Paul Katz, a man Mr. Asaro suspected of being a government informant. Mr. Asaro and Mr. Burke had strangled the man with a dog chain, according to Mr. Valenti. Mr. Valenti said he helped them bury the body underneath the basement concrete. James Burke, a powerful Mafia associate and a friend of Mr. Asaro's. In “Goodfellas,” Robert De Niro plays the character based on Mr. Burke. U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York In the late 1970s, Mr. Asaro was formally inducted into the Bonannos: Vinny Asaro was a made man. Mr. Zuccaro recalled being at a club called Little Cricket that night. When Mr. Asaro walked in, someone played a song called “Wise Guy,” and then “the whole neighborhood knew,” Mr. Zuccaro said. Soon, Mr. Asaro would show he merited the honor. Rolf Rebmann was working his usual midnight-to-7-a.m. shift at Building 26 at Kennedy Airport on Dec. 11, 1978, when he heard a “holler” from outside the terminal. His co-workers were upstairs in the lunchroom for their 3 a.m. meal break, so Mr. Rebmann, a Lufthansa security guard, walked outside to see a man standing near a black Ford van. “I asked him if I could help him, and he said ‘No,’ and stuck a gun in my face and told me to get in the van face down,” Mr. Rebmann testified. The assailants wanted Mr. Rebmann’s keys to open the overhead door, and then they walked him upstairs to the lunchroom. “Somebody kept saying: ‘Just do as you’re told, do as you’re told. We don’t want to hurt anybody.’” Led by Mr. Burke, they had been tipped off to the valuable cargo shipments by an airport employee. They had pulled off what was then billed as the largest cash robbery in United States history, stealing $5 million in cash and $1 million in jewels. Gaspare Valenti, who testified he was one of the two men who attacked the guards, said Mr. Asaro had allowed him to come. In planning sessions at the Queens social club Robert’s Lounge, Mr. Burke, Mr. Asaro, Mr. Valenti and several other men looked over airport plans, and agreed to visit the terminal at least twice to map out escape routes, Mr. Valenti testified. Mr. Asaro drove Mr. Valenti to Mr. Burke’s house the night of the robbery, giving him a .38 hammerless pistol and an instruction: “‘Anything happens, just stand your ground and continue to do the robbery the best you can,’” Mr. Asaro told him, Mr. Valenti testified. Mr. Asaro and Mr. Burke said they would wait in a decoy car a mile away, and the others piled into a van and headed for the terminal. When they got into the vault, one of the robbers, Tommy DeSimone, took a box from a shelf and stepped on it, Mr. Valenti testified. “The yellow Styrofoam popcorn popped out of the boxes, and Tommy put his hand in there, and he pulled out two packages of money,” Mr. Valenti said. “Tommy says, ‘This is it! This is it!’” Tommy DeSimone was one of the Lufthansa robbers, according to trial testimony. U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York After unloading the haul in Mr. Valenti’s basement, Mr. Asaro left for Fat Andy’s social club. When Mr. Valenti, feeling “euphoria,” met him at Fat Andy’s, Mr. Asaro issued his warning to be careful. Mr. Asaro was: He stayed away from Mr. Valenti for a while, kicked up $100,000 to his captain, distributed jewelry to the Five Families to keep the peace and asked friends to hold on to the cash so it wasn’t in one place. He even worried that throwing out the cardboard boxes that contained the cash might draw unwanted attention. So he came up with the idea for Mr. Valenti to sell Christmas trees, so a cheery bonfire would not look out of place. He had reason for the concern. Headlines throughout that December blared about the daring robbery, and by just after Christmas, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation were watching Mr. Asaro visit Mr. Burke’s house in Queens. In the years after Lufthansa, the participants who were still around had enough money that they should have been able to stop working. Mr. Valenti got his $750,000 share, as did Mr. Asaro. Most of the others were killed or disappeared (deaths prosecutors attribute in part to Mr. Burke, who died in 1996 while serving his sentence). Mr. Asaro, smart enough to stay alive, aware enough not to talk too much about Lufthansa, apparently still wanted a little fun. He gambled heavily, and started a Rockaway Boulevard nightclub called Afters, which Mr. Valenti said was a reference to “After Lufthansa.” Mr. Asaro acted, in some ways, as if it were the 1950s and the mob were at its height. He placed bets at Aqueduct. He played handball and paddleball, poker and Continental. He oversaw truck hijackings and armored-car robberies. In a series of surveillance photographs, he seemed the picture of easy confidence. He even waved at an F.B.I. agent one day, according to testimony. But it was the 1980s, and the Mafia, after years of prosperity and influence, was beginning a steep decline. The police and F.B.I. agents infiltrated the mob. Federal prosecutors charged the bosses of the Five Families using a powerful racketeering act, and four of the five were imprisoned (the fifth was killed before trial). Suddenly, even friendly local politicians stopped supporting the families. On the other side, the Mafia was getting squeezed by crime syndicates from Japan, Russia, Mexico and Eastern Europe doing drug trafficking, human trafficking and arms dealing. The mob, though it still made money from extortion and gambling, was not evolving, and neither was Mr. Asaro. Into the 1990s, Mr. Asaro was still threatening neighborhood shops. An Ozone Park resident, Guy Gralto, testified that when he opened his chop shop in the 1990s, Mr. Asaro asked for “protection money.” When Mr. Gralto could not pay, Mr. Asaro hit him and said that “when he was done with me my mother wouldn’t be able to ID my body,” Mr. Gralto testified. Joseph C. Massino, the former Bonanno family boss, was the first official boss of a New York crime family to cooperate with federal authorities. U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York But as he grew older, his bosses considered Mr. Asaro “hostile,” as Mr. Vitale, the former Bonanno underboss, put it. In the 1990s, the boss demoted Mr. Asaro because “he was abusing his leadership position by ‘robbing’ the individuals who reported to him,” and was low on money from too much gambling, prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors do not name the mob boss in the papers, but the details they give match those of Joseph C. Massino, who later began cooperating with the government. Prosecutors discussed calling him to testify at Mr. Asaro’s trial, according to transcripts. An enfeebled New York Mafia limped into the new millennium. One associate, Peter Zuccaro, enthralled with the Mafia since he was a teenager, declined the offer when he was told he was being made around 2000. “I didn’t need it,” he said; he began informing a few years later. In 2003, Mr. Vitale started cooperating with the government, and helped convict more than 50 Mafia figures. That was followed by a once-unthinkable betrayal. In 2005, a mob leader flipped for the first time. It was Joe Massino, Mr. Asaro’s onetime boss. Mr. Asaro did not seem to question it when his cousin Gaspare Valenti, who had been in Las Vegas and not speaking to Mr. Asaro, returned to New York and befriended him in 2010. Mr. Valenti was secretly working with the F.B.I. By then, Mr. Asaro was hobbling around trying to generate cash. “I don’t come out early no more,” Mr. Asaro said in 2010. “Where am I going? I got no place to go.” Since his divorce in 2005, he had been on bad terms with his only son, Jerome, a Bonanno captain. His jewelry had been in hock for two years. He still went to Fat Andy’s, where he had celebrated the Lufthansa robbery, but “people hate me in there: I don’t pay my dues,” he told Mr. Valenti, his cousin, in a conversation Mr. Valenti recorded. Jerome Asaro, Mr. Asaro's son and a Bonanno captain, struck a plea bargain. U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York He tried to look sharp, though his idea of sharp by then was fresh sneakers and a jacket from Kohl’s. As other organized crime was getting ever more sophisticated — hacking into bank accounts, stealing identities — Mr. Asaro was still talking about small robberies and little shakedowns. He worried he was so irrelevant he would be kicked out of the Mafia altogether. “They’re going to take my badge away. You’re going to see, it’s going to happen,” he told Mr. Valenti in 2011, according to a recording played in court. By 2012, the group’s waning membership was such that he told Mr. Valenti that he was promoted to captain again. It did not change his fortunes. “I ain’t got a penny. I swear to God. No gas. Twenty dollars can you lend me?” he told Mr. Valenti. In 2014, the F.B.I. finally closed in, arresting Mr. Asaro at his girlfriend’s Howard Beach residence. Prosecutors charged him with racketeering conspiracy, including the Lufthansa robbery and Paul Katz’s murder, and extortion. Four other Mafia members, including his son, were arrested the same day. They all struck plea bargains. Mr. Asaro did not. During the trial, which started in October, traces of Mr. Asaro’s verve were on display. He insisted on a clear line of sight to the turncoats, mouthing obscenities as they testified. Some moments struck him as amusing — when he heard a tape of himself telling Mr. Valenti he had a “face made of [expletive] plutonium,” he put his head in his hands and chuckled. But the trial made it clear. Omertà was no more. People above him had flouted the code, people below him had flouted the code, and the last one left was Mr. Asaro clinging to his credo. He seemed angry and betrayed. Partway through the trial, angry that his lawyers were not cross-examining more aggressively, he asked to speak to Judge Allyne R. Ross of Federal District Court. “I just want some input in the case, your honor,” he said. “This is my life. This is my life. I’m 80 years old.” Sarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting, and Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

The goal is for Americans to limit added sugar to no more than 10 percent of daily calories, according to the proposed guidelines. For someone older than 3, that means eating no more than 12.5 teaspoons, or 50 grams, of it a day. That’s about the same amount of sugar found in a can of Coke, but for most people, giving up sugary soft drinks will not be enough to meet the recommendations. Caloric sweeteners like sugar, honey and high-fructose corn syrup are found in obvious places like sodas, cookies and candy — but they are also lurking in foods with health appeal, like low-fat yogurt, granola and wholegrain breads, as well as in ketchup, pasta sauce, canned fruit and prepared soups, salad dressings and marinades. “There is a lot of hidden sugar in our food supply, and it’s not just in sweets,” said Dr. Frank Hu, a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard. Sugar can be hidden in foods like, clockwise from top left, granola, yogurt, pasta sauce and canned fruit. Todd Heisler / The New York Times Currently, nutrition labels on food packaging reveal only the total amount of sugar in a product. The F.D.A. has said it wants to change the labels to help consumers distinguish between the amount of naturally occurring sugar and the amount of added sugar. “When you see a yogurt with pictures of blueberries and strawberries on the label — right now there could be a teeny tiny amount of real fruit in there and an awful lot of added sugar, or lots of fruit and dairy and little added sugar, and the consumer cannot distinguish between the two,” said Susan Mayne, the director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the F.D.A. Critics from the food industry have balked at the sugar cap and the new label requirements, saying the new labels will only confuse shoppers. A study published in The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in June found that people overestimated the amount of sugar in products that listed “added sugars,” and were less likely to buy them. “Metabolically speaking, our bodies don’t differentiate between added and natural sugars,” said Kris Sollid, a dietitian who is one of the study’s authors and director of nutrients communications for the International Food Information Council, which receives funding from food and beverage companies including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. If people are watching their weight, he said, “it’s more important to look at total calories.” Dietitians agree that knowing total calories is important, but note that added sugars represent empty calories, devoid of nutrients. While milk and fruit contain natural sugars, they are nutrient-dense foods that provide calcium, protein, vitamins or dietary fiber. The World Health Organization endorses a 10 percent cap on sugars, excluding those in fresh fruits, vegetables and milk, and urges people to aim even lower, limiting sugars to 5 percent of caloric intake to derive greater health benefits. The American Heart Association also recommends stricter sugar limits, saying women should consume only about 100 calories a day in added sugars — about six teaspoons — and men no more than 150 calories, or nine teaspoons. The F.D.A. is recommending that children 1 to 3 should not consume more than 25 grams of sugar a day. Nearly half of the added sugar consumed in the United States comes from sweetened drinks, much of it in soft drinks, but also in sweetened tea and coffee, fruit drinks and sports drinks, according to analyses from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The 10 percent cap was derived from modeling different kinds of healthy diet patterns — American, Mediterranean and vegetarian — and determining how many discretionary calories are left over for sugar after an individual ge the nutrients he or she needs, said Dr. Susan Krebs-Smith,, the chief of the risk factors assessment branch at the National Cancer Institute. “When all that’s taken into consideration, there’s a very small allowance for discretionary calories, or what some people call ‘empty calories,’” Dr. Krebs-Smith said. She compared the new sugar recommendations to living on a budget. “If we were advising the public on how to spend their money,” she said, “we wouldn’t have trouble telling them to focus on spending on essentials like food, shelter and clothing.” Sugar makes up about 13.5 percent of Americans’ caloric intake, so public health experts think the goal of 10 percent is attainable. But that’s an average figure: Younger people, blacks and the poor tend to consume higher amounts of sugar and would need to make deeper cuts to reach the goal. Children and teenagers over all get 16 percent of their calories from sugar, a figure that drops to 14 percent of calories for adults aged 20 to 39, with further drops as people age, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While dietary guidelines have been encouraging people to cut back on sugar for decades, the focus has largely been on preventing weight gain. But new research suggests a high-sugar diet may have metabolic effects, separate from weight gain, that promote chronic disease by causing inflammation, insulin resistance and hypertension. Most recently, sugar in the diet has also been implicated in cardiovascular disease deaths: A large study led by Dr. Hu reported last year that adults who had the highest intake of sugar — consuming 25 percent of daily calories as sugar — were nearly three times more likely to die of heart disease over a 14-year period, compared with those whose sugar intake was less than 10 percent of calories. Several recent randomized clinical trials have shown that getting children to cut back on sugar-sweetened beverages alone can slow weight gain and fat accumulation. Many experts are convinced that the brain doesn’t register liquid calories the same way it registers calories in food. “Even after consuming 200 or 300 calories from soda,” Dr. Hu said, “you don’t feel satisfied, or full.” But even enthusiastic supporters of the new rules worry that a cap on sugar could boomerang. Sugar is often used to make reduced-fat dairy and high-fiber grains more palatable, so what would happen if people eliminated sugar from their diet? In the 1970s, doctors and nutrition experts began advocating low-fat diets for heart health, leading to a proliferation of low-fat and fat-free products that were high in sugar. When low-carb diets became a fad, food makers responded with low-carb pastas and low-carb brownies that were loaded with fat and calories. “We call this the unanticipated consequences,” said Alice H. Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science at Tufts University who serves on the dietary guidelines committee. “Every time we focus on just one component of the diet, we get in these crazy situations.” Related: For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.
